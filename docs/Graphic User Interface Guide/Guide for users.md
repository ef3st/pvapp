3. ***Plants comparison***: This page provides an overview and detailed comparative analysis of simulation parameters for the PV plants selected by the user. Comparisons can be performed on a seasonal, annual on averaged or summend parameter values, but also on on hourly basis, over a time range that spans either the entire simulation or a user-defined interval.
4. ***Plant Manager***: From this page, it is possible setting the electrical grid of the plant, changing plant setup, both for module and site, and analyses the simulation results both for PV arrays and entire grid. 
  
> **Utility Pages**  
5. ***Guide***: More detailed information on how to use *PVApp*, simulation mechanisms, operation of specialized technical libraries for this purpose and parameter entry can be found in this sectio
>> A tip: When you select this page, the menu in the left sidebar changes, displaying folders and documents related to specific topics. Sometimes, on the first try, selecting a folder below the first one may appear to be blank or inclomplete. In this case:

In the sidebare (on the left) you can select these pages. With the "⚙️" button but you can also change language and setting the auto-save and auto-simulation options, with which operate these operation at each change in the plant setup. The "🔥 Simulate All", insteand, allow to simulate e   verything in one shot.
