# Elements of a PV Array
In order to simulate a *PV* sistem, four are the elements to know:
- ***Module***

> This is the core of simulation. Many parameters define the performance and characteristics of a PV module. To semplify the user's task, it is possible to select a pre-defined module present in the California Energy Commission (CEC) [database](https://www.energy.ca.gov/media/2367) and [SAM](https://zenodo.org/records/14173605) also avilable in a dedicated SAM GitHub [repository](https://github.com/NREL/SAM/tree/develop/deploy/libraries). The parameters from [CEC](#module) and [SAM](#2-sandia-mod-sandia-module-database) modules are described in detail below. 
> Since only a few parameters are essentials for simulations, and databases are not always updated with the latest models, so it is possible to define also a "custom" module by specifying only the ***nominal DC input power***(`pdc0`, in Watt) and the ***power temperature coefficient*** (`gamma_r`, in %/¬∞C, the percentage of power lost in production for each degree above 25¬∞C). [Future-updates](#future-updates)

- ***Inverter***
> Solar modules generate **Direct Current** (**DC**), but homes, appliances and the grid require **Alternating Current** (**AC**). So inverters are necessary in PV systems. These devices, adjust the voltage and frequency of the AC output in order to match the grid standards (e.g. 230V, 50Hz in Europe). 
> In addition, inverters continuosly tracks the **maximum power point** (**MPPT**) of the PV module to maximize energy extraction under varying irradiance and temperature condition. Considering the high variability and potential electrical faults that can occur to a PV system, inverters also provide sessential safeguards against overvoltage, short circuits and ground faults. They include *anti-islanding protection*, which automatically disconnects the PV system during grid outage. [Future-updates](#future-updates)
- ***Mounting***
> The mounting system defines the mechanical installation of PV modules, determining their tilt, orientation, and, where avible, the tracking of the sun. In the most common use case, modules are installed at a fixed tilt and orientation, optimized for the site latitude to maximize annual energy production. More advanced systems adopt single-axis or dual-axis trackers, which continuously adjust the module angle to follow the sun‚Äôs position, thus increasing energy yield but at higher cost and complexity.
In `pvlib`, mounting configurations are modeled through the pvlib.pvsystem.Mount classes, which provide tools to simulate both ***fixed-tilt*** and ***tracking systems***. The library implements typical functions such as `FixedMount`, `SingleAxisTrackerMount`, allowing the user to evaluate the impact of mounting choice on irradiance collection and overall PV performance.  [Future-updates](#future-updates)
- ***Arrays***
> Individual PV modules are almost never connected to a single inverter. By connecting multiple modules, it is possible to optimize the overall system voltage, current and power. `pvlib` accounts for this providing methods to simulate arrays defined by the number of modules connected in series (forming a *string*) and the number of strings connected in parallel. the advantages are many:
> + *Series*: connecting modules in series increases the total voltage - summing the module's voltages - mantaining the same current and so allowing the system to reach the inverter's operating voltage window (typically several hundred volts).
> + *Parallel*: connecting strings in parallel increases the total current while keeping the voltage constant, thereby raising the overall system power.
 The  More then one module connected to a string allow to reach the operating input voltage of the inverter (usually hundreds of V) summing the single voltages; while connecting modules in parralle allows to increase the the currents in single branchses increasing then the total power leaving the voltage constant. 
>> Note: even though this structure is managed by `pvlib`, in this App, the input of *module-per-string* number and the *number-of-string* are set withn the grid section. The inverter output then acts as an input to the grid calculus

#### 3. **Custum parameters**
- Moudule: 
    - pdc0: nominal power of the module (DC) in Watts at STC (Standard Test Conditions: 1000 W/m¬≤, 25¬∞C, AM1.5) 
        - It is the maximum power that the module can generate under ideal conditions. 
        - e.g. a 400 Wp module ‚Üí pdc0 = 400
    - Œ≥_pdc: temperature coefficient of power, in 1/¬∞C 
        - It tells how much the module loses in power for each degree above 25¬∞C (at STC). It is assumed negative, because efficiency decreases as the temperature increases     
        (‚ùó***SO DON'T FORGET TO PUT MINUS WHEN USE IT IN THIS APP***)
        - e.g. Œ≥_pdc = -0.004  ‚Üí  -0.4% per ¬∞C

- Inverter:  [Future-updates](#future-updates)
    - pdc0: nominal DC input power of the inverter, in Watts.
    -> It is the reference value on which the efficiency of the inverter and the clipping are evaluated.

## Future updates
1. It will be possible to set more parameters to define custom modules and inverters
2. The `eta_inv_nom` parameter, i.e. the ***nominal inverter efficiency*** (typically around 96%), will also be implemented soon in the inverter settings and simulation. Currently, the efficiency could be assumed to be 1.0 (‚ùóVERY UNREALISTIC, but the simulations are currently focusing on other kind of analysis).
3. In simulation, it will be possible to consider the shutdown of a PV array suggested by the inverter analysis as happend in the real cases
4. Since `pvlib` does not currently implement a *dual-axis* tracking system, this functionality will be developed and tested. During the development phase, a prototype will be made available as `DevelopmentMount` in the gui selection. Once the implementation is successfully and fully validated, it will be promoted to the `ValidatedMount`.
