> ##### `pvlib` python is a community developed toolbox that provides a set of functions and classes for simulating the performance of photovoltaic energy systems and accomplishing related tasks.
> From: [Here](https://pvlib-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

The `pvlib` package has been selected to simulate the performance of photovoltaic (PV) modules, both as standalone units and interconnected in series-string arrays. Its relatively low learning curve makes it highly accessible while maintaining the robustness and accuracy of the results. The mission of pvlib-python is to provide an open-source, reliable, and interoperable framework, serving as a reference benchmark for the modeling and deployment of photovoltaic systems.
